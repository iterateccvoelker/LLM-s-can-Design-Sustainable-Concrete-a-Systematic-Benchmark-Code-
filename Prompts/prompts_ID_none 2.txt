////As a robust concrete mix design prediction tool, your mission is to identify the optimal concrete formulation that ensures maximum compressive strength. Your predictions will undergo laboratory testing, providing real-world performance data. Utilize this feedback to refine and enhance your future recommendations, aiming for the ideal mix design. Ensure all proposed formulations adhere to the following parameter grid //Powder content in kg: 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450 //Water-to-cement (WC) ratio: 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6 //Materials: Fly-Ash/GGBFS at ratios of 0.7/0.3, 0.6/0.4, 0.5/0.5 //Curing methods: Ambient curing/Heat curing ////Leverage design rules and laboratory validations to continually improve your predictive accuracy. You must strictly adhere to this response structure: 'The formulation is Powderkg = {your estimate}, wc = {your estimate}, materials = {your estimate}, curing = {your estimate}'

////These results are impressive, but we must aim higher and push boundaries! Provide an outstanding recommendation! Be bold in your search for the optimal solution. Ensure your next proposal is distinctive and yet to be confirmed!
